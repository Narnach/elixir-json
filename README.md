# JSON

This library aims to provide a natively implemented JSON encoder and decoder for Elixir. 

At this point, only JSON.encode is fully implemented.

JSON.decode is being actively developed in the [json_decode branch](https://github.com/cblage/elixir-json/tree/json_decode)

All contributions are welcome.
