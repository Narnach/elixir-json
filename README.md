# JSON

This library aims to provider a natively implemented JSON encoder and decoder for Elixir. 

This library is still in alpha and should probably not be used in production environments. 

At this point, only JSON.encode is fully implemented.

JSON.decode will become available at some point :)

All contributions are welcome.
